-> My first command

sudo docker run docker/whalesay cowsay Hello-World!

docker run 
-> The docker run command is used to run a container from an image

docker ps [options]
-> The Docker ps command lists all running containers and some basic information about them such as
   the container I.D. the name of the image we used to run the containers.
   The current status and the name of the container.
-> to see all containers running or not use the -a option.

docker stop name/id of container

-> To stop a running container Use the Dockers stop command but you must 
   provide either the container I.D. or the container name.

docker rm container_name

-> use the docker rm command to remove is stopped or exited container 
   permanently if it prints the name back we are good run the docker ps  
   command again to verify that is no longer a present

docker pull image_name

-> Use the docker pull command to only pull that image and not run the 
   container.

docker images

-> 

docker run -d container_name

->Use -d options ot run docker container in detached mode
  This will run the docker container in the background mode and you will be 
  back to your prompt immediately.

docker attach container_name/id

->Now if you would like to attach back to the running container later run the 
  docker attach command and specify the name or I.D. of the docker container.


docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /home/einfochips/Downlods/Repo/Docker/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home -u root jenkins/jenkins

-> By using this command we do not have to pick password form terminal and create user every time we run command 

docker inspect container_name

-> To inspect docker container

sudo docker run -d -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust --name=db postgres
-> To run postgres in detach mode 

sduo docker history container_name/id 
-> To see how docker image is created.Basically it will show Dockerfile of image


sudo docker system df
-> This command will show the actual memory consumption by image on your device without including any duplicates

->  if you wanted to see a breakdown by image you can actually run the same command with a -v option


Run: docker pull nginx:latest then docker image tag nginx:latest localhost:5000/nginx:latest and finally push it using docker push localhost:5000/nginx:latest.
We will use the same steps for the second image docker pull httpd:latest and then docker image tag httpd:latest localhost:5000/httpd:latest and finally push it using docker push localhost:5000/httpd:latest

-> Let's remove all the dangling images we have locally. Use docker image prune -a to remove them.
