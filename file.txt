Kubernetes : 

-> The API server acts as the front end for Kubernetes the user's management devices command-line interfaces

all talk to the API server to interact with the component cluster.

Next is the etcd key value store the etcd is a distributed reliable key value store used by Kubernetes

to store all data used to manage the cluster think of it this way when you have multiple nodes and multiple

masters in your cluster etcd stores all that information on all the nodes in the cluster in

a distributed manner etcd is responsible for implementing logs within the cluster to ensure there are

no conflicts between the masters the scheduler is responsible for distributing work or containers across

multiple nodes it looks for newly created containers and assigns them to nodes the controllers are the

brain behind orchestration they're responsible for noticing and responding when nodes containers or

endpoints closed down the controllers makes decisions to bring up new containers in such cases the container

runtime is the underlying software that is used to run containers in our case it happens to be Docker

and finally kubelet is the agent that runs on each node in the cluster the agent is responsible for

making sure that the containers are running on the notes as expected.
